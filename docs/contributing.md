## for the impatient developer

```shell
# you need npm 7+ ‚Üí we're using npm's workspaces feature
$> npm --version
# will also install all deps in workspaces + setup pre-commit hooks
$> npm i
# build entire proj once
$> npm run build
# turn on build watcher
$> npm run build:watch
```

Then to work on a test:  
...in terminal 1:

```shell
# start the sample js app
$> npm run _startApp:js
```

...in terminal 2:

```shell
# run a single test with wdi5/wdio
### runs the "test:websever" script from /examples/ui5-js-app/package.json
### in workspace "examples/ui5-js-app"
### but only any test file in /examples/ui5-js-app/webapp/test/e2e/**/* that
### matches "basic" in the filename
### and run in watch mode (browser stays open, test reruns when file changes)
### for true TDD
$> npm run test:webserver -w examples/ui5-js-app -- --spec basic --watch
```

## prerequisites

- **npm >= 7** - because we're using npm's `workspaces` feature
- be accustomed to conventional commits <https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum>

## set up the dev env

Although `wdi5`'s core is written in TypeScript, we're favoring it mainly for type generation: the resulting `*.d.ts` files make using `wdi5` in UI5 Projects both in JS and TS more comfortable, as they're providing code completion and parameter-/usage-hints.

First, check the `workspaces` defined in `package.json`: they denote the "modules"/"projects" contained in here.
Most prominently is `"."`, which refers to `wdi5` (aka `wdio-ui5-service`) itself.

- run `npm i`
  this will also install all dependencies in the workspaces and
  `husky` for pre-commit linting and formatting
- build `wdi5` once via
  `npm run build`
- assure continously transpiling TS -> JS on `**/*.ts` changes via
  `npm run build:watch`

## work on `wdi5`

There are two main parts to `wdi5`:

0. the **Node.js runtime**, coded in `/src`, transpiled to `/dist`
1. the **browser-scope runtime**, in `/client-side-js`

`wdi5` as `wdio-ui5-service` is started via WebdriverIO's `before` hook, in `/src/service.ts`.
Then, the Node.js-browser bridge is injected client-side in `/client-side-js/injectUI5.js`.
Subsequently, the Node.js runtime launches client-side JS execution via WebdriverIO's `browser.executeAsync()` api.

A UI5 control from the browser-scope is represented in `wdi5` in the Node.js-scope in `/src/lib/wdi5-control.ts`.
All browser-scope commands (such as `browser.asControl()`) are provided with `/src/lib/wdi5-bridge.ts`'s `addWdi5Commands()` method.

`wdi5` comes with it's own general-purpose Logger that can be used in the Node.js scope: `/src/lib/Logger.ts`.

Given the continous build watch is running (`npm run build:watch`), hack away at any part!

## work on a test

recommended approach:

- run server in terminal 1
- run test(s) in terminal 2

?> when working in test in one of the sample apps (`/examples/...`) and you don't seem to be getting the latest changes you did in `wdi5`,
"reinstall" `wdi5` (`wdio-ui5-service`) in the respective `npm` workspace by doing `$> npm i` in the project root.

## commiting changes

We're using `prettier` and `eslint` for code-formatting and validation.
Staged files are linted and formatted according to the specs in `.prettierrc` and `.eslintrc.js`.
`git` commit messages are linted to comply with "conventional commits" <https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum>. Additionally, the message subject `wip` is allowed:

```shell
wip(optional scope): the subject of the message
<optional blank line, req if body>
optional body
some more text
<optional blank line, req if footer>
optional 1-line footer
```

Please don't look at the above as restrictions, but rather as conventions: it helps to provide a harmonized codebase, both formatting- and code-style wise. And the coventional commits allow for automtically generating a `CHANGELOG.md` that we all benefit from ("what's new in version ....?"). Also, all of this combined aids tremendously in cutting automated releases - so new features or fixes can be published quickly!

## work on the docs

- npm i -g docsify-cli
- docsify serve ./docs -> <http://localhost:3000>
